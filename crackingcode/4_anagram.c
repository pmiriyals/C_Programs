//Check if 2 strings are anagrams are not

//1. Sort and iterate O(nlogn)
//2. Use a count array, initialize it to 0. Check if the lengths of both the strings are 0. Increment with one string, decrement with the other string. Finally check if all the values of count array is 0. Time: O(n) 2 iterations required, Space: O(n)
//3.
